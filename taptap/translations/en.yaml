  taptap_modules_serials:
    name: Tigo modules names and serial numbers
    description: Tuple of modules friendly names as defined by user and modules serial numbers in the format 'NAME1:SERIAL1, NAME2:SERIAL2,...' Tigo modules serial numbers can be found on the modules barcode stickers or in the Tigo cloud. Serials have 'X-XXXXXX' format. Program will log any unknown serial number so you can use it to discover serials if you do not know them. Be aware that messages with serial numbers are emitted rarely, very often only during night time! Wait as lest 24hrs for the complete discovery! To allow for monitoring to start as soon as possible (before receiving all serials), addon will temporarily assign Tigo modules to the user names randomly at the first run. Once serials are received, addon will enumerate all sensors to match user defined names. Once detected serial numbers and mapping to user names are stored in the addon persistent storage in HA and stored information will be reused for any future addon runs.
